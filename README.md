**UPDATE** Prickly-Pete has been fully updated for 2025 (DEF CON 33). Some of the **amazing** improvements include:

* newer honeypot containers, with updated code and builds 
* more ports now exposed by default (**23** at last count)
* ability to pre-build containers so they're ready to run when needed (`./pp build`)
* logs and all output collected as docker volumes now, output shows you were the files/directories are saved to (`./pp volumes`)
* however, DEF CON is still canceled 

## Overview 
Prickly-Pete is a script that uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to quickly bring up some honeypots exposing a bunch of services. For research, reconnaissance and fun. While originally built to run on a laptop during the [DEF CON](https://defcon.org/) hacker conference to see how many pings and pokes we could attract, it's a useful tool for research, and reconnaissance to test networks for infestations. Using Docker and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to containerize all the honeypot services greatly speeding up deployment time while reducing system requirements. 

## Security?
While this project is designed to help identify security issues, and was culled from others who likely have security in mind, I would NOT recommend running this in production environment without a complete security audit... but then again, YOLO!

## Honeypots
prickly-pete uses Docker and Docker-Compose to bring up the following honeypots, automatically, with no configuration or extra steps necessary.

### Existing
* [Conpot](https://github.com/mushorg/conpot.git) - an ICS honeypot with the goal to collect intelligence about the motives and methods of adversaries targeting industrial control systems
* [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie.git) - an SSH/Telnet honeypot, originally based on Kippo
* [Heralding](https://github.com/johnnykv/heralding.git) - a simple honeypot that collects credentials, currently supporting: ftp, telnet, ssh, http, https, pop3, pop3s, imap, imaps, smtp, vnc, postgresql and socks5.
* [Honeyaml](https://github.com/mmta/honeyaml) - an API honeypot whose endpoints and responses are all configurable through a YAML file, supports JWT-based HTTP bearer/token authentication, and logs all accesses into a file in JSON lines format

## Requirements

Prickly-Pete will run on any 64-bit computer that has `git`, `Docker`, and `Docker-Compose` installed and running. I've developed this in Linux, so it's been fully tested in Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, and CentOS. I'd expect it to work pefectly under Mac OSX too, and while I haven't tried in Windows *"it should work"* since it all runs in Docker with no modifications. Give it a try and let me know if it works for you, pull requests welcome!

## Usage

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
* Install [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Checkout `prickly-pete` and change into the directory

```
git clone https://github.com/philcryer/prickly-pete.git && cd prickly-pete
```

* Build

Build all the honeypot services

```
./pp build
```

* Up

Up starts all the honeypot services (implies `build`)

```
./pp up
```

* Status

Check the status of the services (normal `docker ps` stuff here)

```
./pp status

* Logs

Tail all the logs in realtime

```
./prickly-pete logs
```

* Stop

Stop all services

```
./prickly-pete stop
```

### Output

All logs, and any downloaded malware or other bits, can be found in the docker volumes. To see the locations of the files:

```
./pp volumes
```
These will persist after the process ends, and subsquent runs will add to those same volumes. To clear them:

```
./pp nuke
```


### Issues

* If you get any errors when you're first running prickly-pete, they'll likely look something like this:

```
ERROR: for pricklypete_conpot_1  Cannot start service conpot: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint pricklypete_conpot_1 (cc7d3b484bcf24a08b63792c5188deddb19fd9809eaf35df15fa92ac024e4a99): Error starting userland proxy: listen udp 0.0.0.0:161: bind: address already in use
```

Errors like this means that the port (in this case 161) is already taken, and something, in this case SNMP, is listening on the port. To fix this just open `docker-compose.yml` in a text editor, comment out the offending port, and try to use one of the alternative ones I have listed by uncommenting them. I have options for 22, 80, 161 since those tend to be the ones that are running, but for more fun, turn off those services on your localhost and let prickly-pete use them for the time being!

* Another issue could be that you're running a firewall blocking access to ports, you'll want to stop or turn off any firewalls on the host that you're running prickly-pete on so that everything gets through! Another idea if you're inside a network (like at home) set your router to forward all traffic to a [DMZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMZ_(computing)), and then set that DMZ to be the IP of the host running prickly-pete, this is an easy way to begin to understand all the *noise* that is contantly being broadcast on the internet, and why an active defense is neccessary.

* If you're having issues outside of these basic things, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/philcryer/prickly-pete/issues), or ping me on Twitter where I'm [@fak3r](https://twitter.com/fak3r).

* Of course if you've fixed something yourself, or have an improvement you'd like to suggest, [pull requests](https://github.com/philcryer/prickly-pete/pulls) are always welcome!

## Testing

Once up, see what you can see using various system tools, which should be installed on most Unix-like systems.

* ssh

```
ssh localhost -p 22 -l root
```

Passord: `toor`

* nmap

```
$ sudo nmap -p- localhost
